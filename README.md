**Titanic Survival Prediction**
This project aims to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning techniques.

**Dataset**
The dataset used in this project is 'titanic.csv', which contains information about passengers such as age, sex, ticket fare, etc.

**Dependencies**
pandas
numpy
seaborn
matplotlib
scikit-learn

Install the dependencies using:
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn

**Description**
Titanic Survival Prediction.ipynb: Python script containing the code for data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, visualization, and prediction.

**Results**
Accuracy of the model on the test set.
Confusion matrix showing true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives.
Classification report displaying precision, recall, F1-score, and support.
Feature importance plot showing the importance of different features in predicting survival.
Correlation heatmap visualizing the correlation between different features.

**Predictions**
The script also predicts survival for existing passengers in the dataset and displays the actual and predicted survival status.
